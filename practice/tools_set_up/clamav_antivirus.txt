## ClamAV â€“ Antivirus Software Toolkit ## 

sudo apt install clamav

sudo service clamav-freshclam stop
sudo freshclam
sudo service clamav-freshclam start

I find that an alternate way to get the database is to download from https://database.clamav.net/daily.cvd, then manually copy it into /var/lib/clamav

sudo clamscan -r -i DIRECTORY

Where DIRECTORY is the location to scan. The options -r, mean recursively scanning and the -i means to only show infected files.
